* Tfvars is where we initialize/define the values for variables

* The variable names SHOULD BE the same ,wherever it is being declared.

* By default, the default .tfvars file name is terraform.tfvars. Any names other than that is given as argument during run time as -var-file=<filename>

* All executions begin at root folder, here it is Staging.

* The parent module is the Root directory (Containing the files with "module" block) and the child module is the reusable template (here, Modules/)

* The output from the child module should be the keywords only,but it can be customised in parent module (for exampls, "public_ip" is the output name from child module     but "staging-instance-public-ip" is the output name for Root module output.
